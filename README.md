The Odin Project - Google Homepage

About

This is a lesson from the Odin Project. The purpose of this project is to build a google homepage replica.
This is not meant to be a fully functioning google hompage.  Search bar, links, drop down menus don't need to
work like the real Google homepage.  After all, this is the first real project and believe it or not I DO NOT WORK
FOR GOOGLE.
